The only relevant column for adding the weather history is the timestamp. One way of adding the weather history would be to do the following:\n","\n","\n","*   start date in the code below would become a varaible with the earliest timestamp from the training data\n","*   end date in the code below would become a variable with the lastest date from the training data\n","*   (This needs to be done with code instead of typing out what the timestamp is. With more training data the first and last timestamp could be different)  \n","*   The weather API will create a dataframe with two columns, the timestamp, and the temperature, however it is only updated every hour so the dataframe sizes aren't the same\n","*   You can add the weather column to the training data, but since it is only from every hour, minutes 1-60 would have the same temperature value\n","*   You can compare the first part of the timestamp in the training data to the first part of the timestamp for the weather data, and if they are the same you add that temperature value to the training data\n","\n","\n","Example:\n","Training data has timestamps 1/18/23 22:00, 1/18/23 22:01, 1/18/23 22:02, 1/18/23 22:03,... up to 1/18/23 22:59 for that hour. The weather dataframe would just have 1/18/23 22:00, 1/18/23 23:00, etc. and the temperature. By only comparing the first part of it \"1/18/23 22:\" and exculding the minute value you could add the weather value. copying and pasting the weather values into the spreadsheet or adding them 60 times may be easier but wouldn't work with new training data or if the data was missing a certain timestamp.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YUWc2uTXLAzv"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NaZfx1tRWnjN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708390302567,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1042,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Bailey","userId":"14671441464794503327"}},"outputId":"9ba984eb-cc05-4941-a841-7fe12d47ef91"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Coordinates 35.74692153930664°E -78.98196411132812°N\n","Elevation 64.0 m asl\n","Timezone b'America/New_York' b'EST'\n","Timezone difference to GMT+0 -18000 s\n","                   date  temperature_2m\n","0   2023-01-18 05:00:00       45.647598\n","1   2023-01-18 06:00:00       44.477600\n","2   2023-01-18 07:00:00       42.767601\n","3   2023-01-18 08:00:00       41.687599\n","4   2023-01-18 09:00:00       40.517601\n","..                  ...             ...\n","115 2023-01-23 00:00:00       42.677601\n","116 2023-01-23 01:00:00       42.587601\n","117 2023-01-23 02:00:00       42.047600\n","118 2023-01-23 03:00:00       41.957600\n","119 2023-01-23 04:00:00       41.597603\n","\n","[120 rows x 2 columns]\n"]}],"source":["import openmeteo_requests\n","\n","import requests_cache\n","import pandas as pd\n","from retry_requests import retry\n","\n","# Setup the Open-Meteo API client with cache and retry on error\n","cache_session = requests_cache.CachedSession('.cache', expire_after = -1)\n","retry_session = retry(cache_session, retries = 5, backoff_factor = 0.2)\n","openmeteo = openmeteo_requests.Client(session = retry_session)\n","\n","# Make sure all required weather variables are listed here\n","# The order of variables in hourly or daily is important to assign them correctly below\n","url = \"https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive\"\n","params = {\n","\t\"latitude\": 35.76,\n","\t\"longitude\": -79.02,\n","\t\"start_date\": \"2023-01-18\",     #THIS IS THE START DATE, CAN REPLACE THIS WITH A DYNAMIC WAY TO GET THE EARLIEST DATE FROM THE TRAINING DATA\n","\t\"end_date\": \"2023-01-22\",\t\t\t\t #THIS IS THE END DATE, CAN REPLACE THIS WITH A DYNAMIC WAY TO GET THE LATEST DATE FROM THE TRAINING DATA\n","\t\"hourly\": \"temperature_2m\",\n","\t\"temperature_unit\": \"fahrenheit\",\n","\t\"wind_speed_unit\": \"mph\",\n","\t\"precipitation_unit\": \"inch\",\n","\t\"timeformat\": \"unixtime\",\n","\t\"timezone\": \"America/New_York\"\n","}\n","responses = openmeteo.weather_api(url, params=params)\n","\n","# Process first location.
