The only relevant column for adding the weather history is the timestamp. this was done by collecting weather history from the https://open-meteo.com/ database. One way of adding the weather history would be to do the following:\n","\n","\n","*   start date in the code below would become a varaible with the earliest timestamp from the training data\n","*   end date in the code below would become a variable with the lastest date from the training data\n","*   (This was done dynamically with code instead of typing out what the timestamp is. With more training data the first and last timestamp could be different)  \n","*   The weather API will create a dataframe with two columns, the timestamp, and the temperature, however it is only updated every hour so the dataframe sizes aren't the same\n","*   You can add the weather column to the training data, but since it is only from every hour, minutes 1-60 would have the same temperature value\n","*   You can compare the first part of the timestamp in the training data to the first part of the timestamp for the weather data, and if they are the same you add that temperature value to the training data\n","\n","\n","Example:\n","Training data has timestamps 1/18/23 22:00, 1/18/23 22:01, 1/18/23 22:02, 1/18/23 22:03,... up to 1/18/23 22:59 for that hour. The weather dataframe would just have 1/18/23 22:00, 1/18/23 23:00, etc. and the temperature. By only comparing the first part of it \"1/18/23 22:\" and exculding the minute value you could add the weather value. copying and pasting the weather values into the spreadsheet or adding them 60 times may be easier but wouldn't work with new training data or if the data was missing a certain timestamp.\n","\n","\n","**COST CALCULATIONS **\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YUWc2uTXLAzv"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":458},"id":"NaZfx1tRWnjN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710877352203,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2398,"user":{"displayName":"Labib Kasim","userId":"09315335520224240964"}},"outputId":"d64b7960-5aa8-4501-b119-66aac0b4c737"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-7-206ceb33d950>:45: FutureWarning: Argument `closed` is deprecated in favor of `inclusive`.\n","  hourly_time_range = pd.date_range(\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["             timestamp    Total  Washer  BlowerGH  Lights  BlowerBed  CompGH  \\\n","0     01/18/2023 22:00    164.1     0.5       4.6    25.7        1.7    21.7   \n","1     01/18/2023 22:01    164.3     0.5       4.6    25.6        1.7    21.7   \n","2     01/18/2023 22:02    164.1     0.6       4.6    25.8        1.8    21.7   \n","3     01/18/2023 22:03    164.0     0.5       4.5    25.6        1.8    21.6   \n","4     01/18/2023 22:04    164.2     0.6       4.6    25.7        1.7    21.7   \n","...                ...      ...     ...       ...     ...        ...     ...   \n","5771  01/22/2023 22:11   7091.1     6.4       8.9    41.7      225.5    25.2   \n","5772  01/22/2023 22:12   1931.8     6.0       6.3    43.4      226.8    21.1   \n","5773  01/22/2023 22:13   1943.2     6.0       6.4    43.5      227.9    21.2   \n","5774  01/22/2023 22:14   7393.9     6.4       9.2    41.9      225.9    25.6   \n","5775  01/22/2023 22:15  10401.1     6.7      18.7    41.0     5972.9    21.6   \n","\n","      CompBed   Dryer  Recs1  ...
